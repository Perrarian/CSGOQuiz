This page was a real challenge. At first everything worked out smoothly, had almost no issues and the quiz was working perfectly. After changing the file structure 
is when everything went south. Nothing worked. Thankfully after a few hours and help from some people I managed to get it working, except for the high-score page, which is a bummer because it was the best part of the Quiz. I still have the code there, I will try to work around it later in the week but for now Im somewhat satisfied with the result. 7/10.
