I learned a lot in this project and can say that know some of the basics of PHP. I wish I had followed Chris's instructions a little bit earlier because now its confusing, with the initialization from the database to linking everything, giving authorization (which honestly im still not sure why its needed in this case), the errors that came up even after having everything working perfectly and the file structure which almost killed what I had done thus far. All in all I feel good with my progress but I feel I had to this project twice. Once with my guidelines and the second with Chris's.
